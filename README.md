# SNOMED CT Automated Clinical Coding

# This repository contains a collection of folders, scripts, and Jupyter notebooks developed as part of a Master's Thesis:
# "Automated Clinical Coding of Medical Notes into the SNOMED CT Medical Terminology Structuring System."
# This work was completed for the MSc in Fundamental Principles of Data Science at the Universitat de Barcelona.

# The repository is organized into four main folders:

# - application: 
#   Contains the script for vital signs detection and an example script that demonstrates this function. 
#   The examples correspond to those used in the written report.

# - data: 
#   This folder is where all data should be stored. 
#   Separated train-test data should be placed in the subfolder train_test_data.

# - methods: 
#   Includes the two methods with the modifications as explained in the thesis.

# - submissions: 
#   This folder is designated for submission files containing predictions generated by the methods, 
#   which are used to calculate the metrics.

# Each folder contains detailed information within.

# Additionally, the repository includes three key files:

# - Data_exploration.ipynb: 
#   A Jupyter notebook that explores the initial notes and annotations data.

# - metrics.py: 
#   A Python script that contains functions to calculate metrics such as macro-averaged intersection-over-union, 
#   F1-score, and macro-averaged F1-score.

# - Metrics_calculation.ipynb: 
#   A Jupyter notebook that serves as an example of metric calculation using the data from the submissions folder.
